// OuterAck is one confirmation a hop passes inward on behalf of a neighbour
// further out (§3.3). A hop sends its own revision in X-Chain-Seen and the
// acknowledgements it has collected from its direct outer neighbours in
// X-Chain-Outer, base64 of a JSON array of these.
//
// That is how the registry learns how fresh every hop is without ever calling
// a box: the panel hears only the first inner, and everything beyond it
// arrives on that hop's own poll.
//
// Front is that neighbour's front report as it arrived in its own
// X-Chain-Front (#140): the panel hears only the first tier directly, so a
// hop further out gets its move to 443 into the registry this way. Absent for
// a box that does not report one.
